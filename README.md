## Run the project Locally:
After cloning repository 
Install the dependencies
1. cd frontend - yarn install (why not npm install ? simply because this project is using yarn lock)
2. cd backend - npm i 
3. create .env file in backend at root level (copy from .env.example file provided in the project)
   change the values of respected fields with your credentials
   accesskey and the secret access keys are referring to aws (check this guide on how to get those https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oBHvl1hurE)
4. now run both frontend and backend by cd into those and npm start command
5. Lets create some users(including admin) and some dummy products
   simply hit these two urls to seed some data into database
   * http://localhost:5000/api/products/seed
   * http://localhost:5000/api/users/seed
6. All set. Your project must be already opened in the browser (if not simply hit http://localhost:3000)
